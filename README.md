# Monty-Python

An OOP oriented realization of the classical Snake Game written using C++ programming language and presented in CLI format.

The game was designed as a semester project for the course Object Oriented Programming and Principles for the year Spring 2020.

Best efforts were made to include all the OOP related principles inside the code base to have a hands on learning through real world projects.

Following is the list of features that were included in the game (seeked inspiration form the original game):

    1) A boundary wall which the snake cannot cross through at any given time, doing so will lead to elimination.
    
    2) Food is provided in two ways:
    
        2.1) a small random food pops up incrementing length/score
        
        2.2) a bonus big food pops up incase of consuming 5 small foods that remains for a limited time only (giving increased lenght than usual)
        
    3) The winning condition is defined as to achieve MAX height possible, while remaining enlosed in the boundary.
    
    4) A highscore board to maintain the scores achieved by different players.
